# Epson-printer-bruteforcer
### A very hacky script for brute-forcing Epson printer's  Admin Panel username/password.

I forgot our Username and Password for our Epson SC-P9500 printer.
To both reset or change password of the printer, you need top know the old password. Apparently the only other way to "fix" this is to send the printer to Epson.

So instead I quickly hacked together a basic brute-forcer that would try combinations I think could be correct.
Sure enough, it worked and I managed to find the username and password.
